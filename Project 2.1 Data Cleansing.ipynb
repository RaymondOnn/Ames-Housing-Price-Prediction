This method of pricing is known as hedonic pricing.

    "Three linear regression models (Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge, Lasso) were evaluated. Prior to model fitting, the dataset was first put through a variance threshold with the threshold set at 0.01, allowing features with variance 0.01 or higher to pass through. Next, the features are normalized using the Standard Scaler after splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. During, model fitting, 5-fold cross validation was done on the train dataset for all three models. Subsequently, the models were also fitted on the test dataset\n",

    "At the end, Ridge Regression was selected as the model of choice with the highest test R-squared score at 0.905 and the lowest test RMSE at 0.1246.The Ridge model also outperformed the Null model, which gave a baseline R-Squared of 0.00 and a baseline RMSE of 0.4111\n",

    "Above ground living area, total rooms above ground and 1st floor area can be seen as proxy for the land area of the property as by buying the property, buyers essentially have ownership over the land for which the property sits. The more land you purchase, the higher the price."
